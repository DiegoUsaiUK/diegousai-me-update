      <description>This is the minimal coding necessary to assemble various data feeds and sort out the likes of variables naming &amp;amp; new features creation plus some general housekeeping tasks. It includes general housekeeping tasks like sorting variables names, creating essential features and sorting out variables order
I will continue to add to this code should the need arise for other features to be created.
THE DATASET
library(tidyverse)library(lubridate)library(readr)The dataset I’m using here accompanies a Redbooks publication called Building 360-Degree Information Applications which is available as a free PDF download.</description>

      <description>Clustering is one of my favourite analytic methods: it resonates well with clients as I’ve found from my consulting experience, and is a relatively straightforward concept to explain non technical audiences.
Earlier this year I’ve used the popular K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their response to a series of marketing campaigns. For that post I’ve deliberately used a basic dataset to show that it is not only a relatively easy analysis to carry out but can also help unearthing interesting patterns of behaviour in your customer base even when using few customer attributes.</description>

      <title>Modelling with Tidymodels and Parsnip - A Tidy Approach to a Classification Problem</title>

      <description>Recently I have completed the online course Business Analysis With R focused on applied data and business science with R, which introduced me to a couple of new modelling concepts and approaches. One that especially captured my attention is parsnip and its attempt to implement a unified modelling and analysis interface (similar to python’s scikit-learn) to seamlessly access several modelling platforms in R.
parsnip is the brainchild of RStudio’s Max Khun (of caret fame) and Davis Vaughan and forms part of tidymodels, a growing ensemble of tools to explore and iterate modelling tasks that shares a common philosophy (and a few libraries) with the tidyverse.</description>

      <title>A gentle Introduction to Customer Segmentation - Using K-Means Clustering to Understand Marketing Response</title>

      <description>Market segmentation refers to the process of dividing a consumer market of existing and/or potential customers into groups (or segments) based on shared attributes, interests, and behaviours.
For this mini-project I will use the popular K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their response to a series of marketing campaigns. The basic concept is that consumers who share common traits would respond to marketing communication in a similar way so that companies can reach out for each group in a relevant and effective way.</description>

      <description>My objective for this piece of work is to carry out a Market Basket Analysis as an end-to-end data science project. I have split the output into three parts, of which this is the THIRD and last, that I have organised as follows:
In the first chapter, I will source, explore and format a complex dataset suitable for modelling with recommendation algorithms.
For the second part, I will apply various machine learning algorithms for Product Recommendation and select the best performing model.</description>
