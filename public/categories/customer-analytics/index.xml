      <description>This is the minimal coding necessary to assemble various data feeds and sort out the likes of variables naming &amp;amp; new features creation plus some general housekeeping tasks. It includes general housekeeping tasks like sorting variables names, creating essential features and sorting out variables order
I will continue to add to this code should the need arise for other features to be created.
THE DATASET
library(tidyverse)library(lubridate)library(readr)The dataset I’m using here accompanies a Redbooks publication called Building 360-Degree Information Applications which is available as a free PDF download.</description>

      <description>Clustering is one of my favourite analytic methods: it resonates well with clients as I’ve found from my consulting experience, and is a relatively straightforward concept to explain non technical audiences.
Earlier this year I’ve used the popular K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their response to a series of marketing campaigns. For that post I’ve deliberately used a basic dataset to show that it is not only a relatively easy analysis to carry out but can also help unearthing interesting patterns of behaviour in your customer base even when using few customer attributes.</description>
