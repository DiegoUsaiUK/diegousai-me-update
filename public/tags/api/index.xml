      <description>Recently I have completed the online course Business Analysis With R focused on applied data and business science with R, which introduced me to a couple of new modelling concepts and approaches. One that especially captured my attention is parsnip and its attempt to implement a unified modelling and analysis interface (similar to python’s scikit-learn) to seamlessly access several modelling platforms in R.
parsnip is the brainchild of RStudio’s Max Khun (of caret fame) and Davis Vaughan and forms part of tidymodels, a growing ensemble of tools to explore and iterate modelling tasks that shares a common philosophy (and a few libraries) with the tidyverse.</description>
