      <description>Recently I have completed the online course Business Analysis With R focused on applied data and business science with R, which introduced me to a couple of new modelling concepts and approaches. One that especially captured my attention is parsnip and its attempt to implement a unified modelling and analysis interface (similar to python’s scikit-learn) to seamlessly access several modelling platforms in R.
parsnip is the brainchild of RStudio’s Max Khun (of caret fame) and Davis Vaughan and forms part of tidymodels, a growing ensemble of tools to explore and iterate modelling tasks that shares a common philosophy (and a few libraries) with the tidyverse.</description>

      <title>Market Basket Analysis - Part 3 of 3: A Shiny Product Recommender with Improved Collaborative Filtering</title>

      <description>My objective for this piece of work is to carry out a Market Basket Analysis as an end-to-end data science project. I have split the output into three parts, of which this is the THIRD and last, that I have organised as follows:
In the first chapter, I will source, explore and format a complex dataset suitable for modelling with recommendation algorithms.
For the second part, I will apply various machine learning algorithms for Product Recommendation and select the best performing model.</description>
