      <description>My objective for this piece of work is to carry out a Market Basket Analysis as an end-to-end data science project. I have split the output into three parts, of which this is the THIRD and last, that I have organised as follows:
In the first chapter, I will source, explore and format a complex dataset suitable for modelling with recommendation algorithms.
For the second part, I will apply various machine learning algorithms for Product Recommendation and select the best performing model.</description>
